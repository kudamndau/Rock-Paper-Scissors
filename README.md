# Rock Paper Scissors
**Project Title:** Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

**Description:**

This is a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented using JavaScript. It allows users to play against the computer for a set number of rounds. The game validates user input, determines the winner for each round, and keeps track of the overall score.

**Features:**

* User interaction for choosing rock, paper, or scissors.
* Validates user input to ensure only valid choices are accepted.
* Randomly generates computer's choice.
* Determines the winner of each round based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
* Keeps track of the user's score and computer's score throughout the game.
* Announces the winner at the end of the game.

**How to Play:**

1. Open the HTML file (if using a user interface) or run the JavaScript code.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer will randomly generate its choice.
4. The game will announce the winner of each round.
5. After all rounds are played, the game will declare the overall winner.

**Further Enhancements (Optional):**

* Implement a best-of-three or best-of-five format.
* Create a basic user interface using HTML and JavaScript.
* Include additional hand choices like lizard or Spock.
* Allow users to store or view past game results.

**Feel free to replace or adapt this content to better reflect your specific project implementation.**

* Use clear and concise language.
* Use bullet points or numbered lists for easy reading.
* Include screenshots or GIFs (if applicable) to showcase the game's functionality.
* Provide installation instructions if your project requires external dependencies.
* Include your name and any collaborators on the project.
